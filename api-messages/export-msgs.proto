"raw-spectra" - UI choice, exported "Raw Spectral Data Per PMC .csv (and bulk .msa)"

"quant-map-tif" <-- Went unused, was exporting "Floating point map images .tif"
"beam-locations" - UI choice, exported "Beam Locations .csv"
"rois" - Export data dialog checks if this is specified and only allpoints or selectedpoints ROI is selected. "ROI PMC Membership List .csv"
"context-image" - Image options export button defaulted to having this
"unquantified-weight" - UI choice, exported "Unquantified Weight Percent .csv"
"diffraction-peak" <-- Went unused??? was using ui-diffraction-peak instead

"ui-roi-expressions" - UI builds "ROI Expression Values .csv"
"ui-diffraction-peak" - UI built diffraction features CSV (incorporating calibration & diffraction peak data), created anomaly-features.csv
